Technology has a huge impact in our lives.  Using it towards our advantage for learning is something known to be very effective. These technologies vary greatly, however within the focus of this proposal the idea of technology-based learning will be taken to another level. Learning can be done on-the-fly, with the adoption of mobile platforms such as smartphones and iPads. MILAS, the proposed system, is a game oriented environment where questions are distributed to the members from a centralized repository. Where based on the responses and knowledge levels of questions additional help and guidance is provided. The advantage of creating such an environment for these platform is to help students learn and the instructors to find out which subjects the students learned and didnâ€™t learn.
